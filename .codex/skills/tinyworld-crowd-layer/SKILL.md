# TinyWorld Crowd Layer

Use this skill when changing TinyWorld's 2.5D crowd/person sprite system.

## Shape

- Runtime: `vendor/tiny-crowd-layer.js`, exposed as `window.TinyCrowdLayer`.
- Assets: `crowd/`, copied to `dist/crowd/` by `publish.sh`.
- Integration: the visible ambient activity layer in `tiny-world-builder.html`
  now uses procedural 3D vehicles (`makeVehicle()` / `vehicleFleet`) instead
  of visible `THREE.Sprite` people. Keep `TinyCrowdLayer` available as legacy
  code, but do not initialize visible sprite people for normal app activity.

## Rules

- Keep people out of `world[x][z]` and `cellMeshes`; they are moving runtime entities, not terrain/object intent.
- Keep activity vehicles out of `world[x][z]` and `cellMeshes`; they are moving runtime entities, not terrain/object intent.
- Prefer `syncActivityVehicles()` / reserved `activity-vehicle-*` runtime IDs
  for colony activity. Do not create a parallel vehicle model system.
- Activity vehicles may roam across any in-bounds, dry, unobstructed terrain.
  Keep spawning, goals, A* routing, edit rerouting, and the final movement
  guard on the shared vehicle traversability helpers. Adjacent route cells must
  have matching `terrainRiseAt()` values so vehicles never climb or descend
  terrain-height steps; ordinary water and occupied cells remain blocked.
- Ambient trips should prefer randomized, reachable approach cells beside
  placed world objects. Avoid immediately targeting the same object when
  another object is available, and fall back to randomized traversable cells
  when the world has too few reachable object stops.
- When an activity vehicle completes a trip, give that vehicle its own random
  5–10 second dwell countdown before assigning another destination. Dwell
  expiry should trigger independently rather than waiting for the shared idle
  polling interval.
- Use `tilePos(x, z)` for map placement and a terrain-height callback for feet height.
- Preserve the original crowd demo's `P` config surface (`count`, `size`, `slices`, `bob`, `sway`, `headSway`, `leg`, `squash`, `lean`, `hipLine`, `cadence`, `speed`, etc.) when tuning animation.
- Render movement through the original slice-wave canvas animation, then upload that canvas into a `THREE.CanvasTexture` used by a `THREE.Sprite`.
- Size people against known TinyWorld model proportions: default door height is about `0.48` world units, and people should be below that.
- Choose `down/up/left/right` frames from the camera's horizontal angle relative to the person's heading; steep overhead views use a baked collapsed-body `top` frame.
- Each person has a circular zone (`radius`) around its 3D point for collision, hit testing, visibility, and later avoidance.
- Keep the crowd layer vanilla JS with no bundler and no npm runtime dependencies.

## Asset contract

- Character sets need four PNG views: `down`, `up`, `right`, and `left`.
- The imported source repo has a misspelled `charachters/` path; preserve it in copied asset URLs unless migrating all references at once.
- If a sprite fails to load, the layer should degrade to a visible fallback texture instead of breaking app boot.

## Integration checks

- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- Browser page load has no console errors.
- Camera orbit changes swap the visible crowd angle without flickering.
- Reset/load reseeds ambience without saving crowd people into the world schema.
